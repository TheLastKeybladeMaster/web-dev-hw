      <h2>Album Lyrics</h2>
<p>It's now or it's never, and I've got to
Make my decision
This time it could be my moment
Is this a mirage or a chance to fulfill my mission?

A river in a dry land
The last ace in a lost hand
A heartbeat for a tin man
Oasis in a singed land

I'm keeping the balance, but I'm standing
On razor's edge now
Move quick or my life is over
One strike, just a feint, then ...
I'm outa his field of vision
Don't ask why I'm ready but I'm ready to
Strike him down now
A chance at a new start
There's no time for indecision

A river in a dry land
The last ace in a lost hand
When the hope of new beginnings burned our feet
Now we need it:
A heartbeat for a tin man
An oasis in a singed land
Remind us what we're here for:
Creating new life
Creating rivers in the desert

My heart is a furnace
(It's) Hot as hell in my world of conflict
One goal is what keeps me going
Take back what I lost to ...
The bosses of greed and fear, yeah
Don't ask why I'm ready but I'm ready to take
Them down now
The time for a new start
Is constantly drawing nearer

A river in a dry land
The last ace in a lost hand
When the hope of new beginnings burned our feet
Now we need it:
A heartbeat for a tin man
An oasis in a singed land
Remind us what we're here for:
Creating new life
Creating rivers in the desert

When a cool drop of water's all I need
Gotta clear my head of anger and greed
A place to refresh heart and mind
Can I find
Some time in

Rivers in a dry land
The last ace in a lost hand
When the hope of new beginnings burned our feet
Now we need it:
A heartbeat for a tin man
An oasis in a singed land
Remind us what we're here for:
Creating new life
Creating rivers in the desert<p>
