      <h2>Album Lyrics</h2>
<p>It's now or it's never, and I've got to<br />
Make my decision<br />
This time it could be my moment<br />
Is this a mirage or a chance to fulfill my mission?<br />
<br />
A river in a dry land<br />
The last ace in a lost hand<br />
A heartbeat for a tin man<br />
Oasis in a singed land<br />
<br />
I'm keeping the balance, but I'm standing<br />
On razor's edge now<br />
Move quick or my life is over<br />
One strike, just a feint, then ...<br />
I'm outa his field of vision<br />
Don't ask why I'm ready but I'm ready to<br />
Strike him down now<br />
A chance at a new start<br />
There's no time for indecision<br />
<br />
A river in a dry land<br />
The last ace in a lost hand<br />
When the hope of new beginnings burned our feet<br />
Now we need it:<br />
A heartbeat for a tin man<br />
An oasis in a singed land<br />
Remind us what we're here for:<br />
Creating new life<br />
Creating rivers in the desert<br />
<br />
My heart is a furnace<br />
(It's) Hot as hell in my world of conflict<br />
One goal is what keeps me going<br />
Take back what I lost to ...<br />
The bosses of greed and fear, yeah<br />
Don't ask why I'm ready but I'm ready to take<br />
Them down now<br />
The time for a new start<br />
Is constantly drawing nearer<br />
<br />
A river in a dry land<br />
The last ace in a lost hand<br />
When the hope of new beginnings burned our feet<br />
Now we need it:<br />
A heartbeat for a tin man<br />
An oasis in a singed land<br />
Remind us what we're here for:<br />
Creating new life<br />
Creating rivers in the desert<br />
<br />
When a cool drop of water's all I need<br />
Gotta clear my head of anger and greed<br />
A place to refresh heart and mind<br />
Can I find<br />
Some time in<br />
<br />
Rivers in a dry land<br />
The last ace in a lost hand<br />
When the hope of new beginnings burned our feet<br />
Now we need it:<br />
A heartbeat for a tin man<br />
An oasis in a singed land<br />
Remind us what we're here for:<br />
Creating new life<br />
Creating rivers in the desert</p>
