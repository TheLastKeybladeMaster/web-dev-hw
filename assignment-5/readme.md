#Assignment 5 readme

Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.

divs: DIVs help structure and contain content. They are used for organization, allowing unique styling for certain parts of a website, clarity, and grouping.

classes: A class is an attribute that defines what type of object an element is. This is used to group similar elements together for referencing and organization.

ids: An ID is an attribute that labels an element for referencing and organization. Each ID should be unique.

spans: A span is an inline equivalent of a DIV. It is used primarily to emphasize certain elements within a page.



Why might I consider third-party over self-hosted media?

You don't have to worry about bandwidth usage, the file sizes are small, most third party media is optimized for different devices, it's easy to use, you get more social traffic, and the player is simple and familiar.


Summarize your work cycle for this assignment. Review this page if you need some ideas.

Basically the same as the others. This was a little more challenging as I had to download all of the software over again as I am using my friends set-up while I stay with him in Colorado. I also have to focus more heavily on file management as I wish to erase everything when I depart as to not take up space on his computer. But yeah, Read through the assignment and the reading at the same time, fill in the blanks, yada yada yada...

Embed a screenshot of your workspace at some point during your development cycle.
