    <h>About The Author</h>

    <p>Clayton is an avid gamer of all varieties. Whether it be video games, card games, or board games, Clayton prefers to spend his time having fun either by himself, or with his friends!
      Clayton Has been playing Magic: The Gathering for over 3 years. After being introduced to the game by a friend, Clayton has come in second three out of the four tournaments he has participated in.
      But Clayton prefers to play the game casually with friends! As long as he's having fun, it doesn't matter why he's playing!<p>

  <p>Magic: The Gathering is owned by Wizards of the Coast. Instructional videos can be found on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> or at their <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles">website</a>. A great way to learn is to watch people play on twitch, or to watch pro tournaments on youtube. Below is the finals from the last pro tour.</p>
