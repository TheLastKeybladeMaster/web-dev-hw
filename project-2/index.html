        <p>Magic: The Gathering (or MTG for short) has been around since 1993, and has a player base of over twenty million.</p>
        <p>Getting into this massive franchise can be rather difficult, but I'm here to help you understand how to build a basic MTG deck!</p>
        <p> To get started, I recommend buying the following from your local game store: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A pre-made deck</li>
          <li>A starter box</li>
          <li>As many packs of cards as you feel comfortable purchasing</li>
        </ul>

    </div>
    <div id = "Concept" class = "container">
      <h2 ALIGN="CENTER"> What to think about! </h2>
      <p> There are five colors in Magic and seven main Card Types. Below is a table that lists all of these</p>

      <table>

         <tr>
            <th scope="row">Colors</th>
            <td>White</td>
            <td>Blue</td>
            <td>Black</td>
            <td>Red</td>
            <td>Green</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <th scope="row">Card Types </th>
            <td>Artifact</td>
            <td>Creature</td>
            <td>Enchantment</td>
            <td>Instant</td>
            <td>Land</td>
            <td>Planeswalker</td>
            <td>Sorcery</td>
         </tr>
       </table>

      <p> It's generally a good idea for beginners to play one or two colored decks. Any more and problems can cause complications. Even professional players generally stick to two or three colors</p>
      <br>
      <p> Also, try to have some diversity in your card types. A nicely balanced deck will win more times than a poorly balanced one.</p>

      <h2 ALIGN="CENTER"> What to do! </h2>
      <p>Before you decide which pre-made deck you should buy, you should figure out what colors fit your play-style the best. Each color specializes in different areas, so you should choose the color(s) that suit you the best!</p>

      <br>
      <p style = "color:#FFFFFF;"> White decks focus on protecting the player and the things the player controls. These decks are good for people with protective or defensive playstyles. </p>
      <img src="./images/Plains.jpg" alt="Plains Land Card" title="Plains" width="300" height="500" />

      <br>
      <p style = "color:#003EFF;"> Blue decks focus on strategy, denying opponents their cards while strengthening themselves. These decks are good for players with a tacticle mindset and an affinity for the word "No".</p>
      <img src="./images/Island.jpg" alt="Island Land Card" title="Island" width="300" height="500" />
      <br>
      <p style = "color:#000000;"> Black decks focus on winning, even at the cost of their own victory. These decks play heavily on causing themselves harm in order to cause greater harm to their opponents. These decks are good for players who favor the high risk high reward ideology.</p>
      <img src="./images/Swamp.png" alt="Swamp Land Card" title="Swamp" width="300" height="500" />
      <br>
      <p style = "color:#FF0000;"> Red decks are faster paced and focus on winning quickly. These decks are good for people with an agressive playstyle. </p>
      <img src="./images/Mountain.png" alt="Mountain Land Card" title="Mountain" width="300" height="500" />
      <br>
      <p style = "color:#155B16;"> Green decks focus on building strength and overwhelming their enemies. These are good for players who likes to grow their power.</p>

      <br>

      <ul>
        <li>When you have decided on one or two colors, find a pre-made deck to buy and buy a starter box of the same set of cards. Then, purchase as many cards as you feel comfortable purchasing!</li>
        <li>Next, figure out what type of deck you've purchased. Does it favor a specific card type? Do you have additional copies of the same card? If so, try to add more copies! You can have up to 4 of the same card in a deck!</li>
        <li>Next, add as many cards as you'd like! just remember these tips:  <ul>
    <li>Try to have 20-24 land in your deck. Any more or less will cause problems</li>
    <li>Keep your deck size to 60 cards. As tempting as it may be to put in more cards, it will cause inconsistancies to your deck! 60 is the minimum amount of cards you can have in a deck!</li>
    <li>Try to have a variety of card types. At least 4!</li>
    </ul></li>
      </ul>
      <li> Finally, run a few tests! Draw a hand of seven cards, and see how the deck will play out! pick out cards that don't seem to help the deck much and try to replace them with more efficient cards!</li>
