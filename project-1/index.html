<h2>Kingdom Hearts Letter/Poem</h2>

<h3>Square Enix</h3>
<hr>
Thinking of you, wherever you are<br />
We pray for our sorrows to end,<br />
and hope that our hearts will blend.<br />
Now I will step forward to realize this wish.<br />
And who knows,<br />
starting a new journey may not be so hard<br />
Or maybe it has already begun.<br />
There are many worlds.<br />
but they share the same sky<br />
one sky, one destiny.<br />
