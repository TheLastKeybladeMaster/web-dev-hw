      <h3>The Boy Who Lived </h3>

    <p><b><span class="name">Mr.</span></b> and <b><span class="name">Mrs. Dursley</span></b>, of number four, <b><span class="name">Privet Drive</span></b>, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.</p>



      <p><b><span class="name">Mr. Dursley</b> was the director of a firm called <b><span class="name">Grunnings</span></b>, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. <b><span class="name">Mrs. Dursley</span></b> was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
      neighbors. The <b><span class="name">Dursleys</span></b> had a small son called <b><span class="name">Dudley</span></b> and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.</p>


      <p>The <b><span class="name">Dursleys</span></b> had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the <b><span class="name2">Potters</span></b>. <b><span class="name">Mrs. Potter</span></b> was <b><span class="name">Mrs. Dursley's</span></b> sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, <b><span class="name">Mrs. Dursley</span></b> pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as un<b><span class="name">Dursley</span></b>ish as it was possible to be. The <b><span class="name">Dursleys</span></b> shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the <b><span class="name2">Potters</span></b> arrived in the street. The <b><span class="name">Dursleys</span></b> knew that the <b><span class="name2">Potters</span></b> had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the <b><span class="name">Potters</span></b> away; they didn't want <b><span class="name">Dudley</span></b> mixing with a child like that.</p>

      <p>When <b><span class="name">Mr.</span></b> and <b><span class="name">Mrs. Dursley</span></b> woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening
      all over the country. <b><span class="name">Mr. Dursley</span></b> hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and <b><span class="name">Mrs. Dursley</span></b> gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming <b><span class="name">Dudley</span></b> into his high chair.</p>

      <p>None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.</p>

      <p>At half past eight, <b><span class="name">Mr. Dursley</span></b> picked up his briefcase, pecked <b><span class="name">Mrs. Dursley</span></b> on the cheek, and tried to kiss <b><span class="name">Dudley</span></b> good-bye but missed, because <b><span class="name">Dudley</span></b> was now having a tantrum and throwing his
        cereal at the walls. <b><span class="spoken">"Little tyke,"</span></b> chortled <b><span class="name">Mr. Dursley</span></b> as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive.</p>

      <p>It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign ofsomething peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, <b><span class="name">Mr. Dursley</span></b> didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head
      around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of <b><span class="name">Privet Drive</span></b>, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking
      of? It must have been a trick of the light. <b><span class="name">Mr. Dursley</span></b> blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As <b><span class="name">Mr. Dursley</span></b> drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It
      was now reading the sign that said <b><span class="name">Privet Drive</span></b> -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs. <b><span class="name">Mr. Dursley</span></b> gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward
      town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.</p>
