 I have decided to take this class because it is part of my Media Arts minor. I am a computer science major and decided that this class would be useful for both of these fields.
 - The Internet and the web are different, but very similar.
 - The internet wasn't used until 1969
 - Micheal from V sauce is exactly what I imagined he'd be.
 - No one and everyone controls the internet
